# bootstrap-web

I use this "theme" as the framework for most of my websites, so I decided to
finally use a central repository to store this stuff.

I developed this theme originally in [gotodo](https://github.com/ohnx/gotodo) and decided that it looked OK enough to be able to
take out and use in other projects.

The theme is a bit weird. No hamburger for mobiles, it uses a monospace font, and it's *green* instead of blue.
